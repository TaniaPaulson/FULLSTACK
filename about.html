<h2 style="font-family:	Courier New;">HELLO I'M TANIA PAULSON</h2>
<p style="text-align:left; font-size:22px; margin-right:20px;">I'm currently pursuing BTech in the field of Information Technology. I did my schoolings at Avila Convent Matric Hr.Sec.School. I'm a highly motivated and ambitious individual. I have participated in various inter college competions and also presented a paper in the national Conference. I have also done many certification courses in various fields and honed my skills through these courses.  I'm also well-versed with Java-Programming language and hold a nptel certification for successfully completing the course. I have a strong understanding on "FULL STACK" technolgy and I'm  always looking to learn more. My hobbies include painting and doing craft works. In the future I hope to become a good human and a  web developer since I have a great passion and interest in this domain and would work dedicatedly and sincerely. </p>
